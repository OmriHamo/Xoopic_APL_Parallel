# I find thatxgrafix will build but will crash if you link against the system

# currently my best solution has been using macports for tcl/tk and other deps.
# once you have macports, you can get the dependencies
# with the following:

# sudo port install imagemagick +no_x11 bison fftw automake libpng tcl tk
# add 'hdf5' to the end if you also want hdf5

# I also recommend getting gfortran / gcc 4.2 from AT&T:

 'make -j 4' (for 4 threaded compiling)
 and install with:
 'make install' or 'sudo make install', depending on whether you have write
